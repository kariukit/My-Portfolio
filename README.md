# Portfolio

 This is a Webpage containing my portfolio
 
 The challenge was to create the webpage from scratch that met the following criteria;
 
GIVEN the employer needs to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN the employer load the portfolio
THEN the employer is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN the employer clicks one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN the employer click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN the employer am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN the employer click on the images of the applications
THEN the employer am taken to that deployed application
WHEN the employe resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN the employer am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

The mock-up website was to resemble the images below
