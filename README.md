# Portfolio

 This is a Webpage containing my portfolio
 
 The challenge was to create the webpage from scratch that met the following criteria;
 
GIVEN the employer needs to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN the employer load the portfolio

THEN the employer is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN the employer clicks one of the links in the navigation


THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN the employer click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN the employer am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN the employer click on the images of the applications

THEN the employer am taken to that deployed application

WHEN the employe resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN the employer am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

The mock-up website was to resemble the images below
